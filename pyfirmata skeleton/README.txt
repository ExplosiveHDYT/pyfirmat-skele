You need to install the Firmata software on your arduino by going to 
File >>> Examples >>> Firmatas >>> Standards Firmata

I would also recomend replacing on line 55 from
int analogInputsToReport = 0;; //reporting is off 
to 
int analogInputsToReport = 1;; //reporting is on

Due to legal limitations I can not provide the file, you will be required to go find it/download it yourself.
This software is required for the Firmaata code to function properly.
